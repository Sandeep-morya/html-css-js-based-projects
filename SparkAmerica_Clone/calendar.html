        SparkAmerica works hard to build community and be accessible to
        everyone, because leaders come in all shapes, sizes, and levels of
        ability so there's something for everyone, all year round. The
        challenges and events on the SparkAmerica Calendar are designed by
        experts in lifestyle coaching and behavior change science for the total
        health of participants. That means subjects like nutrition, mental
        health, sleep, and even financial wellness will be covered.<br />The
        physical challenges, like the Fit City Challenge, are based on Active
        Minutes. That means that anyone can participate, because all you need is
        to be active for at least 10 minutes a day. All kinds of activity - walk
        your dog, garden, roller skate, play basketball, dance, hike,
        skateboard, swim - count toward your Active Minutes!<br />All of our
        challenges utilize the
